The player takes control of a wizard who travels through a multitude of procedurally generated levels to get to the final boss. This is a top down video game using 90's style pixel art and will be reminiscent of Zelda or Pokémon Mystery Dudgeon. The player gets to choose their abilities such as water, fire, earth, and air abilities. These abilities will either be offensive or defensive as there will be auto spawned enemies on each level of the dungeon. There will also be pickups that will help the player regenerate health and abilities. Our audience consists of gamers who enjoy older style video games. This game will also appeal to those who like magic and exploration games. The users will interact with the game by choosing their character abilities, picking up items, exploring the dungeon, and killing monsters. All interaction is done with a keyboard with the visuals being displayed to the screen. GitHub URL: https://github.com/cse442-fall-2019-offering/442projects-wizard-hack.gitZenHub URL: https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/wizard-hack-5d719360cc744741fb8566cc/board?repos=206670154We do not need a webserver or a database.When a dispute arises, we will flip a coin and go from there. If it doesn't work, we can go back and take the other route.
